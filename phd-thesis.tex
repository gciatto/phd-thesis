\label{chap:introduction}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the last decade we have witnessed an explosion in the exploitation of artificial intelligence (AI) both in the academy and in the industry in virtually all strategical sectors.
%
This is not the first time in history that AI attains unprecedented levels of attention, expectation, and fundings, yet it is the first time that such momentum is driven by a pervasive adoption of data science (DS) and, in particular, machine learning (ML).

Nowadays, the tree terms -- AI, DS, and ML -- are often used mistakenly interchangeably, especially by practitioners.
%
Should we speculate on what the causes of such phenomenon are, we argue this is likely due to the strong hype characterising modern data-driven solutions---both in theory and in practice.
%
This leads both researchers and practitioners to focus on the development of data-driven frameworks or technologies which, in turn, create a sampling bias making people think that ML exhausts DS, and DS saturates AI.
%
As we further discuss in the subsequent chapters, this is really far from the truth.
%
There are many interesting aspects of AI which lay outside the realm of DS.
%
Notably, in this thesis we focus on computational logics (CL)---a prominent aspect of AI populating the portion which is not covered by DS.

As sub-fields of AI, both DS and CL share the common goal of mimicking human intelligence.
%
Of course, they do so in different ways.
%
They focus on different notions and aspects of intelligence, they pursue intelligence through different ways, and for different reasons.
%
Notably, most differences lay in the way CL and DS treat \emph{knowledge}, and, in particular, in the way knowledge is represented, acquired, manipulated, and transferred.

CL, for instance, focuses on rational intelligence, which relies on \emph{symbolically} represented knowledge, either acquired via logic induction or via manual handcrafting, manipulated via logical inference (e.g. deduction or abduction), and transferred by simply presenting symbols into shared formats.
%
Dually, DS focuses on intuitive intelligence, which relies on sub-symbolically (e.g. \emph{numerically}) represented knowledge, commonly acquired from data via ML, manipulated via algebraic or differential operations, and transferred in disparate, purpose-specific ways.

This thesis stems from the acknowledgement that CS and DS are complementary rather than in competition.
%
It aims to \emph{elicit} and \emph{enable} the many possible bridges among the two fields.

On the one side, we \emph{elicit} analogies, dichotomies, and possible synergies among CL and DS by analysing them along four orthogonal dimensions, corresponding to as many knowledge-related activities, namely:
%
\begin{description}
    \item[representation] | i.e. the way knowledge is expressed and made interpretable by either machines or human beings, or both; e.g. via symbols, formul\ae, or tensors of real numbers 
    \item[acquisition] | i.e. the way novel knowledge is learned from prior information, mined from data, or attained from external sources; e.g. via data mining, via induction, or via interaction 
    \item[inference] |  i.e. the way decisions, suggestions, recommendations, or predictions can be automatically computed out of prior knowledge; e.g. via automated deduction/abduction, or via classification/regression
    \item[explanation] | i.e. the way knowledge can be transferred to another entity---be it computational or human
\end{description}

On the other side, we acknowledge that both CL and DS have a prominent overlap with computer science (CS) and software engineering (SE).
%
Regardless of how they manipulate knowledge, both approaches subtend a mathematical modelling of many computational aspects, which must then be reified into well-engineered software technologies to let practitioners actually exploit them. 
%
Accordingly, we further analyse CL and DS from both a computational and technological perspective.
%
While the computational perspective focuses on \emph{what} data structures, algorithms, and workflows they leverage upon to attain intelligence, the technological perspective focuses on \emph{how} such aspects can be translated in practice, via robust software architectures and effective implementations.
%
Along this line, in particular, we assess the current state of the art for technologies laying at the intersection among DS and CL -- or supporting the construction of bridges among the two fields --, identifying holes and proposing lacks to overcome them.
%
The latter in particular is the contribution by which we \emph{enable} the actual combination of CL and DS in practice.

\paragraph{The technological view}

There exists a popular tweet spinning around Twitter since a few years about the difference among artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
%
It essentially states the main difference lays in the underlying programming language: ``if it is written in Python, it probably ML; if it is written PowerPoint, then it is probably AI''.
%
The fun fact here is that PowerPoint is not programming language.
%
The tweet is of course deliberately provocative, somewhat disrespectful, and ultimately raw.
%
However, it brings a number of points which are very useful to understand the scope of this thesis.

This thesis lays at the intersection among computational logic (CL), computer science (CS), software engineering (SE), and data science (DS).
%
While CS and SE are two sides of the same coin, CL and DS are two pretty large and fertile islands in the archipelago of AI.

It may sound like a trivial detail but the tweet above, despite its rawness, is still able to discern among ML and AI.
%
In a world where the two terms are mistakenly being used interchangeably, this particular point should be appreciated.
