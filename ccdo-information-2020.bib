	Abstract = {In this chapter1 we will give an overview of real-life applications developed with constraint logic programming. Constraint logic programming (CLP) combines declarative logic based programming with specialised constraint solving methods from arti{\_}cial intelligence, Operations Research (OR) and mathematics. It allows the clear and concise expression of a wide class of combinatorial problems together with their e{\_}cient solution. In parallel with ongoing research in this field, CLP is now increasingly used to tackle real world decision making problems. In a first part of the chapter, we will briefly present the methods and tools used for CLP and describe typical application areas. We introduce the concepts of global constraints, meta-heuristics and constraint visualisation, which are central to large scale constraint solving.},
